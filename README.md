##Arduinoboy Micro##

This project is meant to make a functional Arduinoboy with the boards that has the ATMega32U4 chip mounted on it (Eg: Arduino Leonardo, Arduino Micro, Sparkfun Arduino Pro Micro).

As stated by myself and by various users around the web, the code made by Timothy works only on Arduino devices that has the ATMega168/328 chip.

My intention is to make a full working code that that can be uploaded on ATMega32U4 devices.
